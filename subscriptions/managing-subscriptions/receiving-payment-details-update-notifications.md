# Receiving payment details update notifications

You can use the Subscription Service Notification (SSN) to send updated payment details notifications emails to shoppers to increase the card update and renewal success rate for a subscription. A notification allows you to prompt a customer to update their card before it expires.

## Triggering a payment details update notification

An SSN is triggered when:

* A Customer Service Representative (CSR) [updates a shopper's subscription information](https://help.digitalriver.com/help/gc/Customer-Service/Managing-subscription-details.htm#ViewingAndModifyingSubscriptionInformation) from [Global Commerce](https://gc.digitalriver.com/gc/ent/login.do).

* A shopper [updates their billing option from the Self-Service section of your online store](https://help.digitalriver.com/help/gc/Customer-Service/Customer-service.htm#CustomerSelfService). The shopper can use the Self-Service section to edit the existing payment method or add a new payment method.&#x20;
