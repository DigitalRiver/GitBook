# Documentation requirements

There are numerous ways to integrate with the [Digital River APIs](../../). Every integration, however, should be well documented. The following lists some of the key documentation tasks that we've identified.

Depending on your integration approach, some or all of these documents may be required. If you're building an integration on behalf of Digital River, we'll supply you with a documentation template.

Click on each task to view live documents from an assortment of existing integrations. You can use these examples to help you organize and write your own documentation:
