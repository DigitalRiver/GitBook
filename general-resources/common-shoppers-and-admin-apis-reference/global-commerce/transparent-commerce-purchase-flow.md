# Transparent Commerce purchase flow

Use Transparent Commerceâ„¢ to instantly purchase a product on behalf of a customer during an authenticated customer session. This API bypasses calling the [Apply Shopper](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-shopper-api/#tag/Apply-Shopper) and [Submit Cart](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-shopper-api/#tag/Submit-Cart) resources separately and instantly purchases a single product. A typical example of a product purchased via this resource is auto-renewal, such as a subscription.

The product direct purchase API performs the following actions with one Shopper call:

1. Adds a product to the cart.
2. Applies the default customer address to the cart.
3. Applies the default payment option to the cart.
4. Submits the cart.
5. Creates an order.

Send the `POST shoppers/me/products/{productId}/purchase` request with the specific product ID for the product that the customer wants to purchase.&#x20;

The following example purchases a product with a product ID of `291233200`. The response header contains a `Location` header, as shown in line 4, to the order that was created for the transaction. The ID of the order is `1234567890`. The request and response bodies are empty.
