# Products

A product (a stock keeping unit or SKU) is a sellable item or service. Products in your Digital River catalog contain all required attributes to complete an end-consumer transaction (payments, tax, and fulfillment). You can generally configure the product in one of two ways:

* An [individual product](../../../../admin-apis/product-management/retrieve-products-synchronous-api/getting-a-base-or-individual-product.md) (single sellable SKU)
* A [base product with variants](base-product-with-variations.md) (base product with multiple sellable SKU variants)

You can retrieve your catalog product information, including applicable discounted prices by leveraging the available product endpoints.
