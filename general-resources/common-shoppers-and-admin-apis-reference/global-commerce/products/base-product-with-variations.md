# Base product with variants

You can create a product grouping consisting of a base product (parent) and one or more sellable SKU variants (children) of that base product.&#x20;

All variants inherit the common attributes of the base product. Change the appropriate attributes in the variation to make it unique. You can change nearly anything about a variation so that it differs from the base product. But you should only change those settings or attributes that are unique to the variation to reduce operational maintenance.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: A customer cannot add a base product to a cart; they can only add the variant SKUs of that product to a cart. In an online storefront, an interstitial page appears for variants so customers on a Digital River-Hosted store pageThe can choose a product variation. On a Digital River-Hosted store page, the store template automates and controls this behavior.
{% endhint %}

The following image shows an example of a base product with a variant page:
