# Private stores

You can use [Global Commerce](https://gc.digitalriver.com/gc/ent/home.do) to create a private store. The site owner, who has a Private Store Manager role in the Global Commerce user interface (UI), configures private stores at the site level. Private stores allow sites to target segmented shoppers, called a target market. Sites can deploy, rotate, and retire private stores to suit current product marketing trends.

**Note**: In the Global Commerce UI, private stores used to be called purchase plans, and the APIs reflect the former nomenclature in version 1 (v1)

For information on submitting an order for a private store, see [Private Store](../../../shopper-apis/product-discovery/private-stores/private-store-1.md).
