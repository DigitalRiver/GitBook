# Release notes

V1 is the base version of the Commerce API. The following dates indicate when we released updates to this version.

## 2023/2/xx

*   We replaced the Commerce API Reference with a Commerce API suite that includes the following API references:

    * The [Shopper APIs Reference](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-shopper-api/) provides the resources for an end-to-end ecommerce experience used when our Global Commerce platform is the system of record. The Shopper APIs allow clients to build a storefront, create shopper workflows, operate their store, and display products. For more information, see [Shopper APIs](../../shopper-apis/shopper-basics/) and [Common Shopper and Admin APIs](../common-shoppers-and-admin-apis-reference/).&#x20;
    * [Admin APIs Reference](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-admin-api/) allows administrators to programmatically create, update, deploy, and retire products on your storefront, create and edit products in bulk, manage product data, and manage sites and subscriptions. Use the Admin APIs when you want to host the Cart and Checkout pages and manage your products via API. For more information, see [Admin APIs](../../admin-apis/product-management/getting-started.md) and [Common Shopper and Admin APIs](../common-shoppers-and-admin-apis-reference/).&#x20;

    Note that the [Shopper APIs](broken-reference) and the [Admin APIs](broken-reference) each require a different [set of roles and permissions](../../master/getting-started/roles-and-permissions.md).
* We also updated the following topics:
  * [Getting started](../../master/getting-started/)
  * [Error codes](../../error-codes/)
* We added information on how to [resume cart submission](../../shopper-apis/cart/resuming-cart-submission.md).
