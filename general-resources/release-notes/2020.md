# 2020

## 2020/12/30

* We now offer a [PHP SDK](https://github.com/DigitalRiver/digital-river-php) to help you integrate the Digital River API into your commerce application. When building your integration, we recommend you review our [standards and certifications](../standards-and-certifications/). Here you'll find information on the [certification process](../standards-and-certifications/certification-process.md), our [compliance requirements](../standards-and-certifications/compliance-requirements.md), and the available [integration checklists](../standards-and-certifications/integration-checklists/).
* You can now [apply store credit](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/applying-a-store-credit.md) to non-recurring transactions. Store credit allows merchants to offer customers a store credit as a payment type at checkout.

## 2020/12/28

We updated the [supported geographies](../../payments/payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/payment-methods/klarna.md#supported-geographies) for [Klarna](../../payments/payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/payment-methods/klarna.md) to show the minimum and maximum order amount and the payment method type.

## 2020/12/17

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Breaking changes**

We made the following changes in version `2020-12-17`:

* You can no longer set the `visible` boolean parameter in a [create](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#operation/createFees) or [update](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#operation/updateFees) Fee request. By default, all [fees are now visible](../../product-management/regulatory-fees/managing-regulatory-fees.md#displaying-fees) to customers.
* [Landed cost](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/landed-costs.md) taxes are no longer included in the `totalTax` of an Order. They are now returned in [`totalImporterTax`](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/landed-costs.md#order-level-attributes).
{% endhint %}

* We now return several attributes at the [order-level](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/landed-costs.md#order-level-attributes) and [item-level](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/landed-costs.md#item-level-attributes) that represent the [landed cost](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/landed-costs.md) on an order. We now also provide the ability to [refund importer taxes](../../order-management/returns-and-refunds-1/refunds/issuing-refunds.md#specifying-the-type-of-refund).
* We now return [fee details at the item level](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/accessing-regulatory-fee-information.md#getting-information-on-individual-fees).
* We added the [best practices](../../developer-resources/best-practices.md) for using the Digital River API that includes [API keys](../../developer-resources/best-practices.md#api-keys), [versioning](../../developer-resources/best-practices.md#versioning), [versioning and API keys](../../developer-resources/best-practices.md#versioning-and-keys), [robustness](../../developer-resources/best-practices.md#robustness), and [fraud detection](../../developer-resources/best-practices.md#fraud-detection).
* We made the following changes to the [Digital River Dashboard](../../administration/dashboard/):
  * You can apply a different [API version](../../administration/dashboard/developers/api-keys/) to each individual key ([standard ](../../administration/dashboard/developers/api-keys/#standard-keys)and [restricted keys](../../administration/dashboard/developers/api-keys/creating-a-restricted-key.md)), or you can[ update the version on all keys](../../administration/dashboard/developers/api-keys/updating-your-api-version.md) simultaneously in the current mode (test or production).
  * You can now [rotate a webhook's secret](../../administration/dashboard/developers/webhooks/rotating-a-webhooks-secret.md).
  * Changed the Orders section to [Order management](../../administration/dashboard/order-management/).
  * Changed the All orders topic to [Orders](../../administration/dashboard/order-management/orders/).
  * The [Order details page](../../administration/dashboard/order-management/orders/viewing-the-order-details.md) now displays the item discount, purchase amount, and payment and billing details.
  * Added [Checkouts](../../administration/dashboard/order-management/checkouts/) to the [Order management](../../administration/dashboard/order-management/) section.

## 2020/12/10

We added more [custom styles](../../developer-resources/reference/elements/#available-custom-styles) for [styling an element container](../../developer-resources/reference/elements/#styling-an-element-container) in [DigitalRiver.js](https://github.com/DigitalRiver/GitBook/blob/Digital-River-API-latest/payments/payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js).

## 2020/11/17

When you [delete a SKU](../../administration/dashboard/catalog/skus/deleting-a-sku.md), we now [delete any Fee objects](../../product-management/regulatory-fees/managing-regulatory-fees.md#deleting-a-fee) associated with that SKU.

As part of the [PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](../../payments/psd2-and-sca/) initiative, payment processors require extra information when processing [merchant-initiated](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/initiating-a-charge.md#merchant-initiated) credit card transactions. To ensure that you adhere to the new mandate, you can now make use of [billing agreements](../../integration-options/checkouts/subscriptions/subscription-information-1.md#billing-agreement-identifier).
