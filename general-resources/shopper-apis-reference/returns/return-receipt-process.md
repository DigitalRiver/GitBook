# Return receipt process

You need to include the following information in a Return Receipt:

* The product's condition at an individual quantity basis in the Return Receipt. Some returned products in good condition can be re-sold. Digital River must know when a returned product is in bad condition, based on some fulfiller agreements, so the product will not be re-sold.
* The `externalReferenceID`. Digital River uses the `externalReferenceID` received in the Return Receipt to tell you the location of the returned product within your warehouse so you can dispose of or manage the returned product.
