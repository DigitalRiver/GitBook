# Selling subscriptions with add-ons

Add-on products allow you to add paid or free options to your subscription product. Once you configure them, your customers can add them to their subscription product for an additional fee per renewal cycle. Add-ons are incremental to the main subscription product and follow the subscription renewal cycle. During the subscription, the customers can add or remove add-on products. Once added, they are renewed when the main subscription product is renewed until the customer deactivates them. For more information, see [Assigning a perpetual unit price](broken-reference) and [applying a midterm change with price override](broken-reference).

You can add the add-on product when you [create a subscription product](https://help.digitalriver.com/help/gc/Products/All-Products/Creating-a-product.htm) in [Global Commerce](https://gc.digitalriver.com/gc/ent/login.do).
