To create a Delayed Payment Instructions element, use the `createElement` function exposed through the DigitalRiver Object. You can localize the content by using the localization functionality of DigitalRiver.js.

The Delayed Payment Instructions element also requires an `options` object. The `options` object requires the following attributes:

| Attribute          | Description                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| sourceId           | The source ID.                    |
| sourceClientSecret | The client secret for the source. |

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example" %}

```javascript
let options = {
    "sourceId": "fc8b2df1-2a57-4b2d-82bb-dc62081d76c4",
