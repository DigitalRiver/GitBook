### New look for Digital River Dashboard!

Great news! [Digital River Dashboard](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/) now provides a better and bolder user interface experience while still keeping the features and favorites that you currently use. We have enhanced the [Dashboard’s](../administration/dashboard/) look to serve you better and provide a cleaner overall experience. You will see new navigation icons, cleaner tables and formatting, and a new look in every section of the app. But don't worry - all your favorite features will still be easy to find, and you can navigate the same way you do now.
