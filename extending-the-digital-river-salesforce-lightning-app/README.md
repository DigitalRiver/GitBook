# Extending the Salesforce Lightning app

Each Salesforce Lightning implementation comes with its own business requirements and unique challenges. While the OOTB (Out of the Box) app for Salesforce Lightning can solve some of these challenges with specific configurations, sometimes the business requirements cannot be fulfilled in a configurable manner. That is, the solution requires code. To address these challenges, we provide extension points within the app. These extension points are called by the core app code and allow you to meet specific business requirements for each implementation.

This section includes information on how to **** [extend the Ship From Address](extend-the-ship-from-address.md) and how to [extend the webhook framework](extend-the-app-webhook-framework.md).
