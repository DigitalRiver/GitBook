# Regulatory fees

Some jurisdictions require you to pay an additional fee for certain products. These regulatory fees attempt to reduce the environmental and economic impact of these products.

In the Digital River API, this additional fee is represented by the [Fee resource](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#tag/Fees) and can consist of one of the following [types](managing-regulatory-fees.md#type): battery, packaging, copyright, e\_waste, and WEEE.

You're required to know if your product has any required fees and, if it does, you're responsible for [creating them](managing-regulatory-fees.md#creating-a-fee). Throughout the process, our Tax and Compliance teams will work with you to manage your product's regulatory fees.
