# Compliance obligations

All parties in the supply chain play a role in regulation compliance. Any business that brings products into a European market where regulations are in place is legally responsible for complying with those regulations. Most directives have specific requirements for registration, fee collection (fee values and calculations), point-of-sale display, management and application of fees within a product catalog, and reporting and/or remittance of fees to the appropriate entities. The following roles are involved in regulatory compliance:

* **Producers/Importers:** An entity that brings a product into a market.
* **Retailers and Distributors:** An entity that provides logistical support or brings the product to the customer.
* **Compliance Schemes:** A government-appointed body that manages regulatory compliance for directives in individual markets. Compliance schemes do not manage across multiple countries.
