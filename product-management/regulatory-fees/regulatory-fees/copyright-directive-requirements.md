# Copyright directive requirements

The copyright directive has basic requirements and rules that you must adhere to. Those requirements can be found [here](broken-reference).

## **Compliance requirements**

Each directive has different compliance responsibilities for each entity in the supply chain. As the [reseller of record](glossary.md#reseller-of-record-ror), Digital River (depending on the jurisdiction) will likely assume each role in the supply chain.

### **Producers:**

#### Registration

Register with compliance schemes to provide them with sales volume data.

#### Fee Administration

* Enter fee values and product attributes.
* Associate fees with products and categories.
* Update fee values per required frequency.

#### Reporting

* Run appropriate reports to calculate the required data for each compliance scheme.
* Submit the report to the compliance scheme per required frequency.

#### Payment:

We report volumes and then the copyright agency invoices Digital River for the copyright levy and Digital River remits payment for the invoice to the copyright agency.
