# Fees terminology

## Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE)

Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) is any household, electronic, or technology product that is powered by electricity or battery. Examples of EEE items include refrigerators, telephones, televisions, computers, video game consoles, smoke detectors, power tools, cables, and cords.

## European Union Copyright Directive (EUCD)

Laws regarding the sale and use of reprography and storage devices were created in response to EC Directive [2001/29/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32001L0029).

## Reseller of Record (ROR)

The entity that owns a product when executing a sale or transaction for that product. The ROR is responsible for taxes and fees for transactions in the EU, US, Canada, and potentially other areas in the world (such as the Middle East and APAC).

## Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS 1, RoHS 2, and RoHS 3)

A hazardous substance is any substance that has one or more inherent hazardous properties.

Directives [2002/95/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32002L0095), [2011/65/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011L0065), [2015/65/EU - RoHS 2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0065), and [2015/863 RoHS3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L0863) originated in the European Union. They restrict the use of specific hazardous materials found in [electrical and electronic products](glossary.md#electrical-and-electronic-equipment-eee) (EEE).

## Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)

Electronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Used electronics that are destined for refurbishment, reuse, resale, salvage recycling through material recovery, or disposal are also considered e-waste.

The [2012/19/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32012L0019) directive specifies safe and responsible collection, recycling, and recovery procedures for all types of electrical and electronic waste.
