# What are regulatory fees?

The rise in the use and sale of consumer electronics (CE) has created concern over the economic and environmental impact these products have throughout their lifecycle. This concern has brought about legislation and regulations in North America, Asia, and Europe to address the manufacture, use, recovery, and recycling of CE products throughout the world. These laws affect any business that produces, sells, resells, imports, or distributes a CE product.

There are many terms and phrases you should be aware of when thinking about regulatory fees. You can find definitions for some of these in the [glossary](glossary.md).

**Note**: These topics outline regulatory fee management for sites where Digital River is the [reseller of record (ROR)](glossary.md#reseller-of-record-ror). If Digital River is not the ROR for a store, creating and managing fees, as well as the legal and compliance responsibilities, belong exclusively to the client, and the contents of this topic do not apply.
