# Compliance challenges

Compliance with the EC directives and the resulting laws is critical to success in the global ecommerce marketplace. However, the regulatory fee environment presents several operational, technological, legal, and financial challenges:

* Companies must comply with numerous countryâ€‘specific laws, but the sheer number of laws, inconsistent transition of the EC directives, and variations among the laws make total compliance difficult.
* Registration procedures, mandatory product fees, recycling, compliance schemes, and reporting and payment requirements vary from country to country and sometimes even product to product, making it difficult to keep track of each obligation.
* Because compliance is the obligation of the party that brings the product "to market," there is confusion surrounding who is obligated for products that work their way through the supply chain.
* Pricing models and long-term business goals can be affected and subsequently altered to accommodate requirements.
