# Responding to events

The Commerce API allows you to create and manage events and webhooks. You can use webhooks to subscribe an application to these events and receive notifications when they occur.

| Resource              | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [Events](events/)     | Represents an event in your online store. |
| [Webhooks](webhooks/) | Represents a specific webhook.            |

## Getting started

To enable the Webhook Service for Commerce API, send a request to your Digital River Account Manager and include your site ID and company ID. Your Account Manager will notify you when the Webhook Service is enabled in [Global Commerce](https://gc.digitalriver.com/gc/ent/login.do).
