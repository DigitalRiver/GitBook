# Event types

In the Commerce API, there are many event types. Most integrations only need to subscribe to a relatively small number of them. You can choose what you want to monitor from the list of event types described below. Each of these event types provides an example payload.

Every event type uses the following format: `resource.event`. This makes coding easier since you know all event types use a consistent format.&#x20;

In [Global Commerce](https://gc.digitalriver.com/gc/ent/login.do), when you [create a webhook](../../webhooks/creating-a-webhook.md) or [view the details of an existing webhook](../../webhooks/searching-for-a-webhook.md), you can find the latest list of event types supported in the Commerce API.

The following topics describe the supported subscription event types.
