# Step 5: Configure other store settings

Make the following selections to configure other store settings:

1. From the **Magento Admin panel**, select **Stores**, then select **Conﬁguration.**
2. In **Configuration**, select **Sales**, and then select **Shipping Settings**. Enter your warehouse address in the **Origin** field. By default, this address will be used as your ship from address for all transactions.\
   **Warning**:  Failure to provide this address will cause orders to fail.\
   **Note**: As of 2.3, the `shipFrom` address moved to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Shipping Settings** > **Origin** field. Previously, the `shipFrom` was based on the **Store Information**.
3. Select **Sales**, and then select **Multishipping Settings**. Then click **No** for **Allow Shipping to Multiple Addresses**.
4. Select **Sales**, and then select **Checkout**. Under **Checkout Options**, select **Payment Method** from the **Display Billing Address On** dropdown.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Refresh your browser cache.
