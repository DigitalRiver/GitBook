# Saving payment methods

Currently, a shopper can only save payment methods to their account during checkout. The shopper can choose to save the payment method by selecting the check box named **Yes, please** **save this account and payment information for future purchases**. The saved payment method will not appear in the shopper's **My Account** pages. This functionality will be added in a future release.
