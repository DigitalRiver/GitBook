# VAT invoices and credit memos

Authenticated shoppers can find and download a PDF of their official VAT Invoices and Credit Memos on their **My Account** screen. Guest shoppers can use the **Order Lookup** screen to find and download a PDF of their official VAT Invoices and Credit Memos. As Digital River is the MOR/SOR, the official invoices must come from Digital River. To that end, the links on the **Invoice** and **Credit Memo** screens replace the standard Magento **Invoice** and **Credit Memo** display.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: It can take up to an hour after orders have been completed or credit memos given for the links to appear on these pages.
{% endhint %}

Invoices appear on the shopperâ€™s Invoices tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
The VAT Invoice and the reports within the Digital River [Dashboard](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/login) show the final price of the order. Neither the VAT Invoice nor reports itemize any discounts or the amount paid by a specific payment method if the shopper used multiple payment methods.
