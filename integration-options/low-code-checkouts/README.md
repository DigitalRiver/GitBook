# Low-code checkouts

In this section, you can gain a better understanding of how to implement [Prebuilt Checkout](drop-in-checkout.md) and [Components](implementing-a-components-checkout.md), our low-code checkout solutions.

If you select either of these integration options, you can also use this section to learn how to:

* [Offer local pricing](offering-local-pricing.md)
* [Dynamically access shipping options](using-a-shipping-endpoint.md)
* [Process subscription acquisitions](processing-subscription-acquisitions.md)
* [Add custom fields](adding-custom-fields.md)
* [Give customers access to their store credit](offering-store-credit.md)
* [Collect e-invoice information](collecting-e-invoice-information.md)
* [Handle successfully completed checkout-sessions](handling-completed-checkout-sessions.md)
