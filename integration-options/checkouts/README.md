# Direct Integrations

With Direct Integrations, you primarily use [checkouts](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#tag/Checkouts), along with [Drop-in payments](../../payments/payment-integrations-1/drop-in/) or [Elements](../../payments/payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/), to construct a customer's checkout and payment experience.

In this section, you can read about [how a standard Direct Integrations flow works](process-flow.md). You'll also find information on how to:

* [Build checkouts](creating-checkouts/)
* [Build payment workflows](building-you-workflows/)
* [Manage subscriptions](subscriptions/)
* [Sell products across international borders](../../using-our-services/global-logistics.md)
* [Use Digital River's fulfillment service](handling-digital-river-coordinated-fulfillments/)
