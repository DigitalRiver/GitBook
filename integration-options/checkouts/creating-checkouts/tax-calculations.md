# Tax calculation inputs

To compute taxes, Digital River uses a wide range of data points. The following table lists attributes that affect both initial tax estimates and final tax amounts:

| Tax-relevant attribute    | Resource | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `taxCode`                 | SKU      | The designated [tax code](../../../product-management/creating-and-updating-skus.md#tax-code) of the product or service. Digital River uses the value you provide to classify the product as [digital or physical](../../../product-management/creating-and-updating-skus.md#how-products-are-specified-as-physical-or-digital).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `shipTo`                  | Checkout | <p>Represents an order's <a href="providing-address-information.md#ship-to-address">ship to address</a>. Digital River uses this data to compute taxes on physical goods and (when the attribute is specified) on digital goods.</p><p>A customer <a href="providing-address-information.md#determining-address-requirements">must provide this information</a> to successfully place an order that contains a physical product.</p><p>The data can also be inherited from a Customer object by <a href="using-the-checkout-identifier.md#registered-checkouts">specifying a customer identifier</a> in the Checkout.</p>                                     |
| `shipping`                | Customer | <p>Represents a customer's <a href="providing-address-information.md#ship-to-address">ship to address</a>. Digital River uses the data to compute taxes on physical goods and (when the attribute is specified) on digital goods.</p><p><br>You can pass the object's data to a Checkout by <a href="using-the-checkout-identifier.md#registered-checkouts">specifying a customer identifier</a>. This fulfills the requirement to provide a <code>shipTo</code> value for physical goods even when the value is not explicitly set in the Checkout.</p>                                                                                                      |
| `purchaseLocation`        | Checkout | Use a [purchase location](setting-the-purchase-location.md) when customers have yet to supply either the Checkout's `shipTo` value that is [required to successfully submit an order for physical goods](providing-address-information.md#determining-address-requirements) or the [billing address](../../../developer-resources/reference/digital-river-payment-objects.md#billing-address-object) that is necessary for digital goods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `sources[].owner.address` | Customer | <p>Represents a <a href="../../../developer-resources/reference/digital-river-payment-objects.md#billing-address-object">billing address for a payment method</a> and is used to compute taxes on digital orders.</p><p>You set the address when <a href="../../../payments/payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/reference/digitalriver-object.md#creating-sources">creating a source</a>.<br><br>However, when provided, the Checkout's<code>shipTo</code> value or the Customer's <code>shipping</code> value takes precedence over the billing address.</p>                                                                                              |
| `taxIdentifiers`          | Customer | Allows qualified customers to [purchase zero-rated goods](../../../customer-management/setting-tax-related-attributes.md#tax-identifiers).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `taxCertificates`         | Customer | Allows qualified customers to [make tax exempt purchases](../../../customer-management/setting-tax-related-attributes.md#tax-certificates).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `type`                    | Customer | <p>Providing a <a href="../../../customer-management/setting-tax-related-attributes.md#customer-type">customer type</a> allows you to support tax exemption and zero-rated purchases for <code>business</code> customers.<br><br>In most cases, setting the value to <code>individual</code> nullifies the use of <a href="../../../customer-management/setting-tax-related-attributes.md#tax-identifiers">tax identifiers</a> and <a href="../../../customer-management/setting-tax-related-attributes.md#tax-certificates">tax certificates</a> for tax computation purposes. These attributes, however, may still be used for reporting and invoicing.</p> |
| `customerType`            | Checkout | This attribute is equivalent to the [type attribute in the Customer](../../../customer-management/setting-tax-related-attributes.md#customer-type) resource. However, the value [set in the Checkout](./#setting-checkout-attributes) always overrides the one in the Customer object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `taxInclusive`            | Checkout | Lets Digital River know whether to [subtract taxes from or add taxes to](configuring-taxes.md) the [price you specify](describing-the-items/price-of-an-item.md) for each SKU when [describing items](describing-the-items/) in a Checkout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Tax estimation and computation workflow

The following provides a high-level overview of how Digital River uses a [SKU's tax code](../../../product-management/creating-and-updating-skus.md#tax-code) to classify a product as digital or physical.&#x20;
