# Extending the Digital River Salesforce B2B Commerce App

Each Salesforce B2B Commerce implementation comes with its own business requirements and unique challenges. While OOTB (Out of the Box) App for Salesforce B2B Commerce can solve some of these challenges with specific configurations, sometimes the business requirements cannot be fulfilled in a configurable manner. That is, the solution requires code. To address these challenges, we provide extension points within the App. These extension points are called by the core app code and allow you to meet specific business requirements for each implementation.
