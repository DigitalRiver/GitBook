# Bulk user account export

The Bulk User Account Export service allows you to manage multiple user accounts. When updates occur via the following trigger points, it sends it to the client:

* My account/Reviews
* Checkout
* Customer Service
* HGOP2
* Shopping Cart Service
* User Account
  * User Management Service
  * Remote User management/Single-sign on
  * Bulk User Management Service

The Bulk User Account Export service sends only authenticated user information to the client and encrypts sensitive information. Authenticated users are users that have signed into a Digital River-hosted site that uses authentication.
