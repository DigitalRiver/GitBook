# Shopper basics

Explore the Shopper APIs for the Commerce API suite for an end-to-end ecommerce experience used when our Global Commerce platform is the system of record. The Shopper APIs allow you to build a storefront, create shopper workflows, operate your store, and display products. You can use the Shopper API to programmatically manage:

* [OAuth](../oauth/)
* [Shoppers](../shoppers/shoppers.md)
* [Product discovery](../product-discovery/)
* [Cart](../cart/)
* [Orders](../orders-1/)
* [Subscriptions](../../common-shopper-and-admin-apis/subscriptions/): Note that you can find the subscription information under [Admin APIs](../../admin-apis/subscription-management/) and [Common Shopper and Admin APIs](broken-reference).
* [Events](broken-reference)
* [File management](../orders-1/file-management-1/)

The /`shoppers/me` in the URL represents the current shopper session and the calls that you make on a shopper's behalf to allow the shopper to find and purchase products from an online store.
