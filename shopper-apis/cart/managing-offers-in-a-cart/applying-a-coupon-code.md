# Applying a coupon code

Coupon codes are also called discount codes or [promotional codes](applying-a-promo-code.md) that encourage sales in your stores by providing discounts on products or shipping costs. You can configure a coupon code offer in Global Commerce and apply that coupon code to an active shopping cart to encourage sales in your stores by providing discounts on products or shipping costs.

During the checkout process, a customer manually enters a coupon code in your storefront and clicks the Apply button. The API applies the discount associated with the [POP (Point-of-Promotion)](../../product-discovery/offers/how-to-use-point-of-promotions-pops/) offer to the cart. The call returns the contents of the cart with the adjusted pricing information.
