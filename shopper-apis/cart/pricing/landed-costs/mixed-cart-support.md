# Mixed cart support

A mixed cart contains physical and digital products. To activate the mixed-cart feature, contact your Customer Success Manager. This feature uses a landed cost solution that calculates the landed cost only when all the physical goods in the cart are eligible. If even one item is ineligible, the entire order will not be eligible. Besides this, the mixed-cart function behaves the same as the [landed cost](./) solution, but it has been improved to support mixed carts.
