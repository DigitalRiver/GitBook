# Mixed cart support

You can use the mixed cart feature when your cart contains physical and digital products. This feature calculates the landed cost, which is the total cost of the goods, including shipping and customs fees, only when all the physical products in the cart are eligible. If any physical items are ineligible, the entire order will not be eligible for the landed cost solution. You can use a mixed cart with a tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive landed cart solution. The mixed-cart function works the same as the [landed cost](./) solution with additional support for mixed carts.
