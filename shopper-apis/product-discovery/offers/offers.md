# Understanding offers

An offer is a discount promotion that entices shoppers to purchase a product from your store. Most offers provide a discount on the price of a product or shipping costs. You can create an offer that promotes certain products or encourages shoppers to purchase additional products. See [Offer types](../../../general-resources/shopper-apis-reference/carts/offers/offer-types.md) for more information.

The following image shows an example of how you can display a discount on a category list page.
