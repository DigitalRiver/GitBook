# Contact point address

The **Contact Point Address** represents a contact person's billing or shipping address. The **Country Name** must match the values in the picklist field on the **Product** object for the **Country of origin**. This picklist field has a mapping between the **Country Name** (Label) and **Country ISO Code** (API name).‌

The **Country** field must contain the **Country** (United States) instead of the Country ISO Code (US).

The **State/Province** field must contain a **State ISO Code** (NJ) if applicable and not the State Name (New Jersey).
