# Multi-currency support

The Salesforce Lightning app requires currency ISO codes to be part of the checkout process.

To determine currency ISO codes:

* If multi-currency is **enabled**, the currency ISO code is pulled from the **cart**.
* If multi-currency is **not enabled**, the currency ISO code is pulled from the **user object**.
