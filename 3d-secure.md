# 3D-Secure

The European Union's Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements became effective on September 14, 2019. These new requirements, which are part of the [second Payment Services Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366\_en) (PSD2) regulations, mandate that you conduct that two-factor authentication on certain types of online transactions.

This integration supports 3D-Secure 2.0. Digital River account enables 3D-Secure by default and cannot be disabled. Digital River's Drop-in component brokers the 3D-Secure challenge the shopper experiences at checkout.

See [PSD2 and SCA](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/payments/psd2-and-sca) for more information.
