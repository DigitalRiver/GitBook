* [Step 4: Configure the plugin](configure-the-wordpress-plugin.md#step-4-configure-the-plugin)
* [Step 5: Add the menu to the header](configure-the-wordpress-plugin.md#step-5-add-the-menu-to-the-header)
* [Step 6: Set up Global Commerce content and style](configure-the-wordpress-plugin.md#step-6-set-up-global-commerce-content-and-style)

## Step 4: Configure the plugin

### Step 4a: General tab

1. Click Digital River to open the **Settings** page.
2. On the **General** tab, enter your Site ID, API Key, API Secret, Domain, Payment Services API Plugin Key, Username, and Password. \
   &#x20;<img src=".gitbook/assets/DRSettingsGenl.png" alt="" data-size="original"> \
   Choose whether you want to run a scheduled product import or import your products manually. Leave the box unchecked to import manually. For a scheduled import, click the check box to set the import schedule. The import occurs twice daily to import and sync products every 12 hours (12 hours from the time the box is checked and the time is set).

### Step 4b: Locale tab

Set up to eight locales (synched with language and currencies) on the **Locale** tab to enable localization. (Built-in translation is supported but it is an expectation that the client will audit and customize their own translated content.)

The column at the far right is labeled "Tax Display" Hover over the question mark icon to display the following description: "For the locales with tax-exclusive/inclusive price lists but still need to present tax-inclusive/exclusive prices at storefront." Please contact Digital River or your SI partner to set up tax/locale for the first time.

Note that each locale presents a dropdown menu in the Tax Display column to choose either Inclusive or Exclusive tax display.&#x20;

#### URL Redirects for the Home Page

URL Redirects can now be customized to remain in the userâ€™s locale during site navigation. To keep the chosen locale, find the code on the Appearance tab as shown in the image below.

In the code page for the template or your theme, edit the code to include "**drcg\_**" __ before "**get\_home\_url**" as shown in the following image:

### Step 4c: Checkout tab

On the **Checkout** tab, check the boxes and click **Save Changes** to choose to:

* Enable a test order
* Display pricing as tax exclusive on the checkout flow
* Display the short description along with the product name

#### Test Order

![](.gitbook/assets/EnableTestOrder.png)

Click the check box to set up a working test order. A test order helps you evaluate the flow of placing an order in your WordPress plugin site, including testing the use of payment methods such as credit cards. Test orders display a label at the top of the page, "This is a test order."&#x20;

#### Global Tax management

The plugin supports Global Tax management. Registered shoppers in the U.S. locale can apply their tax exemption in the checkout flow. When enabled for the storefront, a shopper (non-U.S. locale) can apply their "Tax Identifier" in the checkout flow. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For non-U.S. locales, Tax ID is VAT ID at checkout. A valid ID is required and will be validated. The checkout flow displays according to your settings. The following images show a U.S. Checkout example (with tax authority specified) followed by an E.U. Checkout example.
{% endhint %}

### Step 4d: Payments tab

Multiple payment types are available, such as credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and others. Sample code can be found on the [Digitalriver.js](https://docs.digitalriver.com/commerce-api/payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js) and [Drop-in](https://docs.digitalriver.com/commerce-api/payment-integrations-1/drop-in) documentation pages. Your Checkout page will reflect the payment types you choose to have configured for your API keys. On the **Payments** tab, click **Save Changes** to save your settings.
