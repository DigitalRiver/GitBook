# Events

We use [event types](event-types.md) in a webhook to let you know when something interesting happened in a site associated with your account such as a change to a resource. The webhook's Data object will show the data associated with the event.‌ For example, we create a `subscription.created` event when a [subscription ](../../subscriptions/)is created.‌
