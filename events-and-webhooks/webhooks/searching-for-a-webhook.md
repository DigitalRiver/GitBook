3. Type the webhook's entire ID in the **Webhook ID** field on the Webhook Service page and click **Search**. A webhook ID only appears in the search results if it exactly matches the text that you type in the **Search** field.
4. Click the link under the **Endpoint URL** column to view the webhook details.
