# Security

Digital River provides PCI compliance, tokenization, and fraud screening through an API reference. When the shopper enters payment information at checkout, they interact with secure payment fields that Digital River hosts within a client-hosted page. Those secure fields are served up by digitalriver.js, a developer-friendly library that allows brands to securely process transactions without having to take on the responsibilities of PCI compliance. When brands use the digitalriver.js API reference on their store, Digital River serves up payment methods, validates card data, tokenizes customer information, performs fraud screening, collects sensitive card data, and processes transactions in a manner that is fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Digital River is a Level 1 PCI-compliant service provider. Customer data is stored on Digital Riverâ€™s secure servers, never on client servers.
