7. Enter the static conversion rate. The static conversion rate remains the same until you enter a different conversion rate. Using this method avoids constantly fluctuating prices in non-default currencies.
8. Complete the fields under **Currency display** to customize how the currency will appear to customers.
9. Click **Save**.&#x20;
10. To allow shoppers to transact in this currency, click the toggle in the **Visible?** column.&#x20;
