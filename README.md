# Digital River API

## **Start integrating**

Our [Getting started](quick-start-guide.md) guide walks you through the basics of making API requests, setting up a Digital River Dashboard account, and getting your API keys.&#x20;

To better understand some of Digital River's core services and how to use them, we recommend you review the [Using our services](using-our-services/) page.&#x20;

You can also review our various checkout solutions and select whichever option, or combination of options, best fits your business objectives:&#x20;

* [Low-code checkouts](integration-options/low-code-checkouts/): The quickest, easiest way to integrate. Add a turnkey Digital River-hosted checkout experience with minimal code or construct unique checkout flows with our components.
* [Direct Integrations](integration-options/checkouts/): A more customizable way to build your user experience. Use our ready-to-display features and flexible API suite.
* [Connectors](https://docs.digitalriver.com/partner-integrations/): A pre-built integration for your commerce platform. Configure and customize components within your own hosted experience.
