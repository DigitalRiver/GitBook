# Commerce API

## Working with Digital River

More than a global payments and fraud solution, Digital River acts as the authorized reseller of your products. That means we assume the risk of the sale, managing taxes, and regulations on your behalf. To perform these valuable services, we need to first collect some basic data. This data allows us to apply the right tax, process payments, perform fraud screening and comply with local regulations using our legal entities.&#x20;

## Getting started

Continue to our [Getting started](master/getting-started/) section to make API requests. After you perform an API test, you can begin creating products, customers, carts, and orders to provide us with the data we need to protect your business from risk.
