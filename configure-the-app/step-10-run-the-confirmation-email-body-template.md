# Step 8: Run the confirmation email body template

The template is updated for an OOTB (out of the box) order confirmation email to show the payment method from Digital River and digital product handling.

Run the following confirmation email body template after updating the respective content catalog name and version. To do so, copy the contents of the `confirmation_email.txt` file (converted from `*.ImpEx` format) to the SAP Commerce HAC window to load and execute the file.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/confirmation_email (4).txt" %}
Confirmation email body template
{% endfile %}
