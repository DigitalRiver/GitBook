# Operation and maintenance

## Implementation information for WordPress subscription and profile management&#x20;

Your store can be set up for anonymous and/or authenticated shopping. If you use authenticated shopping you can leverage the subscription and profile management features. During checkout, you are prompted to Login (Returning Customer) or Sign Up (New Customer) with a password, now including the added security of using reCaptcha. These options will allow you to access Subscription and Profile Management.&#x20;
