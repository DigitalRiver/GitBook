# Partner integration program

The partner integration program provides an easy way for select commerce and subscription partners to build seamless integrations into Digital River’s [Global Seller Services](https://www.digitalriver.com/global-seller-services/). This program is a game-changer for partners and clients looking for an easy way to access Digital River’s merchant of record solution for simplifying global payments, tax, fraud, and compliance. As a result, partners can offer clients a quick, easy, and risk-free path to entering new global markets with best-of-breed capabilities.

Partners who engage in this program benefit from:

* Reduced “cost to connect” &#x20;
* “Certified” connector to Digital River &#x20;
* Optional white labeling “powered by Digital River” &#x20;
* Financial incentive&#x20;

Digital River has created a Toolkit to help guide partners through the development as well as ongoing sales and promotion.
