# Files and file links

We extended Commerce API access to the [Files ](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#tag/Files)and [File Links](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#tag/FileLinks) resources in the Digital River API. This gives you the ability to make invoices, tax certificates, and other  [files](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/general-resources/digital-river-api-reference/files) available to customers through [file links](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/general-resources/digital-river-api-reference/file-links).&#x20;

You can create, retrieve, and return a list of all files for Commerce API in the same way as Digital River API clients. By providing your secret key in the header, you'll be allowed to submit a Files request.
