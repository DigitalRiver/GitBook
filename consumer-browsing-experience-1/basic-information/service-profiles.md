# Service profiles

The Commerce API supports the following service profile levels:

* **Level 1**–You can only use the API keys in an implementation/evaluation phase (test orders only). This profile creates carts as test orders.
* **Level 2**–You can use the API keys in production (both test and live orders).
* **Level 3**–You can use the API keys in production (both test and live orders). These API keys can create payment options and apply payment methods to a cart. A client can provide credit card details in Commerce API requests.
