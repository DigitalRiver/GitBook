# Dynamic offers / personalization

You can use the Commerce API to define an API-triggered offer in Global Commerce for a bundle, line item, order, and shipping discounts. Once you create an offer in Global Commerce, you can trigger the offer (like an existing URL-triggered offer) by applying either the Global Commerce offer ID or an offer external reference ID (O-ERID) to the API-created shopping cart. The offer contains the discount percentage, amount, or amount off values relative to the discount applied to the shopper's cart. This feature provides three ways to trigger a promotional URL:

* [Skipping Global Commerce Merchandising offer arbitration](skipping-global-commerce-merchandising-offer-arbitration.md)
* [Triggering a promotional URL offer](triggering-a-promotional-url-offer.md)
* [Overriding a promotional URL offer discount](overriding-a-promotional-url-offer-discount.md)
