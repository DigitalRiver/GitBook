## Increase revenue with localized payment processing&#x20;

Our unrivaled global acquiring network increases authorization rates by as much as 30% in some markets and 8-15% across the globe. We successfully process more customer payments because we route transactions through local acquirers, minimizing declines and eliminating foreign transaction fees.

## Shield your business from risk&#x20;

Avoid fatal fines, litigation, and damage to your brand’s reputation by staying compliant with ever-changing tax and data privacy regulations. Worried about filing VAT taxes to multiple tax authorities? We do that for you. Worried about staying compliant with GDPR, PSD2, and other consumer protection regulations? We manage that for you. And we do all this through our unique merchant of record business model.&#x20;
