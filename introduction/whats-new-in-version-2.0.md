# What's new in version 2.0

* The plugin supports [Global Commerce](https://docs.digitalriver.com/commerce-api/consumer-browsing-experience-1/global-commerce) locales and will display supported currencies for each locale in the WordPress Admin.
* The WordPress Admin can specify the language for each locale. Built-in translation is supported but it is an expectation that the client will audit and customize their own translated content.
* Product imports now display a progress bar and also allow an Admin to schedule when the product sync will be initiated.
* The plugin integrates the [Drop-in](https://docs.digitalriver.com/commerce-api/payment-integrations-1/drop-in) functionality, which is Digital Riverâ€™s turn-key payments solution.
* The plugin supports [Global Tax management](../configure-the-wordpress-plugin.md#global-tax-management):
  * Registered Shoppers in the US locale can apply their tax exemption in the checkout flow.
  * When enabled for the storefront, a Shopper (non-US locale) can apply their "Tax Identifier" in the checkout flow.
