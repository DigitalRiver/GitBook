# How it works

1. Use the Salesforce B2B Commerce App to enable Digital River to be the merchant of record for storefronts hosted in Salesforce B2B Commerce.
2. Salesforce B2B Commerce maintains all pricing and product data.
3. Digital River maintains minimal product data to fulfill the requirements for the merchant of record for tax calculations, tax collections, tax payments, and payment processing.
4. Digital River automatically syncs with the CC Product in Salesforce B2B Commerce with minimal information needed to calculate taxes and enable the merchant of record functions.
5. Digital River maintains a copy of the cart, customer, and order.
