# How it works

* Use the Digital River Global Commerce v. 2.1.1 Extension for Magento to enable Digital River to be the merchant of record for storefronts hosted in Magento.
* Magento maintains all pricing and product data.
* Digital River maintains minimal product data to fulfill the requirements for the merchant of record for tax calculations, tax collections, tax payments, and payment processing.
* Digital River automatically syncs with Magento via the extension to acquire the information needed to calculate taxes and enable the merchant of record functions.
* Digital River maintains a copy of the cart, customer, and order, while Magento retains the original data.
