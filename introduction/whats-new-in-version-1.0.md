# What's new in version 1.0

We added the following features:

* Added Subscriptions feature with support for manual/recurring billing.
* Added Profile management for registered shoppers to manage and view orders, addresses, and subscriptions.
* Added Business Checkout via EIN (US only).
* Enhanced Upsell promotion feature.
* Minor Bug fixes.

Note: The guest checkout flow will require registration for the purchase of a subscription Product.

If you want to continue using the original guest checkout flow, the following javascript code is required:

```
<script>document.cookie = 'drgc_guest_flag=true; path=/';</script>
```

You can update your WordPress Plugin to v1.1.0 directly from the WordPress Plugins section.
