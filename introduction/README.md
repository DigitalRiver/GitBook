# Introduction

BigCommerce allows merchants to concentrate on building innovative web applications without worrying about how to bill their customers.&#x20;

The Digital River app on BigCommerce's Marketplace enables a client or brand using BigCommerce's store to activate a powerful global enabler solution that can perform the complex and risky back-end requirements of global expansion so they can instead focus on new markets and grow international sales.&#x20;

The Digital River app plugs directly into BigCommerce's platform, enabling flawless, hyper-localized customer experiences from checkout to fulfillment. It can also be used to expand quickly into new countries while we manage local regulatory compliance, taxes, payments, payment card industry (PCI) compliance, fraud, chargebacks, customer support, and more.
