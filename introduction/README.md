# Introduction

The Digital River Salesforce B2C LINK Cartridge for Commerce Cloud provides a global payment and risk mitigation solution. Digital River enables localized payment methods, tax calculation, and secure localized payment processing to minimize declines and foreign transaction fees. Beyond payments, Digital River works behind the scenes to fight fraud, minimize chargebacks, optimize billing to increase authorization rates, and manage global taxes and regulatory compliance.&#x20;

The Salesforce B2C LINK Cartridge is essential for brands looking to enter new global markets with ease while delivering the right local payment methods, currencies, and tax calculations. This is the only extension brands need for handling payments, taxes, fraud, tax, and compliance.

The cartridge also supports the following:

* API integrations that support Digital River webhooks processing (such as requests and optionally sent email notifications)
* API integrations that support Digital River customer credit functionality
