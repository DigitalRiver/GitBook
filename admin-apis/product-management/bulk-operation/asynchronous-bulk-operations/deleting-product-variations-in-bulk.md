# Deleting product variations in bulk

To delete product variations in bulk asynchronously, follow the instructions for [deleting a product variation](../../manage-products-asynchronous-api/deleting-a-product-variation.md). For example, to delete 100 product variations, [send 100 delete product variation requests](../../manage-products-asynchronous-api/deleting-a-product-variation.md).

After creating the products in bulk, [retrieve the tasks for all products](../../get-the-task-status-for-a-product-synchronous-api/retrieving-the-tasks-for-products.md#retrieving-the-tasks-for-all-products) to verify the status of the requests. You can also verify the successful completion of the task by [checking the product history](deleting-product-variations-in-bulk.md#product-history-attributes) in [Global Commerce](https://gc.digitalriver.com/gc/ent/login.do). Note that there may be a delay before these changes appear in Global Commerce.&#x20;
