# Product management

This guide shows you how to manage products. The `products` in the URL represent the current product administrator session and the calls that you—the developer—make to manage products on your online store.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can use either [Product management](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-admin-api/#tag/Manage-Product-\(Asynchronous-API\)) in Admin APIs, [Global Commerce](https://gc.digitalriver.com/gc/ent/login.do), or [Bulk Product Upload](broken-reference) to create or change a product. However, we recommend not using Admin APIs, Global Commerce, and Bulk Product Upload simultaneously to create or change a product.
{% endhint %}
