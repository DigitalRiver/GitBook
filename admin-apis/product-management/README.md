# Product management

This guide shows you how to manage products. The `products` in the URL represent the current product administrator session and the calls that you—the developer—make to manage products on your online store.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can use either [Product management](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-admin-api/#tag/Manage-Product-\(Asynchronous-API\)) in Admin APIs, [Global Commerce](https://gc.digitalriver.com/gc/ent/login.do), or [Bulk Product Upload](../../shopper-apis/orders-1/file-management-1/file-uploads.md#bulk-product-upload-bpu) to create or change a product. However, we recommend that you do not use Admin APIs, Global Commerce, and Bulk Product Upload simultaneously to create or change a product.
