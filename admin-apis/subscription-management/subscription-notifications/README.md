# Subscription notifications

You can use the Subscription Service Notification (SSN) to send updated payment details notifications emails to shoppers to increase the card update and renewal success rate for a subscription. A notification allows you to prompt a customer to update their card before it expires. To enable SSN, talk to your Digital River representative.
