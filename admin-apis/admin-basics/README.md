# Admin basics

Explore the Admin APIs for the Commerce API suite for an end-to-end administrator experience. The Admin APIs allow administrators to programmatically manage:

* [Refunds](../refunds/)
* [Subscriptions](../subscription-management/): Note that you can find [additional subscription information](../../common-shopper-and-admin-apis/subscriptions/) under [Common Shopper and Admin APIs](broken-reference).
* [Sites](../sites/)
* [Products](../product-management/)
