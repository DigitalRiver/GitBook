# Authorization

To send refund requests, you need [Admin API permission](../../master/getting-started/roles-and-permissions.md#commerce-api-suite-roles-and-permissions) and one of the following [Global Commerce roles](../../master/getting-started/roles-and-permissions.md#global-commerce-roles-and-permissions): Customer Service Director, Customer Service Supervisor, or Customer Service Representative. Also, all refund requests require your [confidential API key](../../resources/API-structure/api-keys.md#confidential-keys) with `/auth`. See [Sending an API call using `/auth`](../../master/getting-started/sending-api-calls.md) for more information. Once the Global Commerce user has permission, the user can send refund requests. Global Commerce records users' activities in the order log.
