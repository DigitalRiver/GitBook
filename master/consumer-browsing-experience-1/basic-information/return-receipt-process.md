# Return receipt process

You need to include the following information in a Return Receipt:

* The condition of the product at an individual quantity basis in the Return Receipt. Some returned products in good condition can be re-sold. When a returned product is in bad condition, Digital River needs to know, based on some fulfiller agreements, so that the product will not be re-sold.
* The `externalReferenceID`. Digital River uses the `externalReferenceID` received in the Return Receipt to tell you the location of the returned product within your warehouse so you can dispose of or manage the returned product.
