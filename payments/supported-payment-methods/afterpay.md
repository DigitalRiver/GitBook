## How to configure&#x20;

Afterpay is primarily used for purchasing physical goods. It has a review process to assess whether your customers can use it to buy digital goods. If you want to sell digital goods, Afterpay will need the following information to conduct the review: company name, website, and Merchant Classification Code (MCC). The MCC is a code that identifies your sales vertical. Provide this information to your Digital River representative.

How you configure Afterpay depends on whether you're using [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payments-solutions/digitalriver.js/) or[ Drop-in payments](../payments-solutions/drop-in/).
