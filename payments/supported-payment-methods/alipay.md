# Alipay

Established in 2004, Alipay is Chinaâ€™s leader in third-party online payments and has an estimated 300 million users. Alipay is a delayed fulfillment payment method, meaning fulfillment occurs after authorization and settlement. It works much like PayPal, where the consumer chooses to make a payment and is directed to the external Alipay site, where they enter (or choose existing) payment information.&#x20;

## How to configure&#x20;

How you configure Alipay depends on whether you're using [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payments-solutions/digitalriver.js/) or[ Drop-in payments](../payments-solutions/drop-in/).
