# Alipay (domestic)

Established in 2004, Alipay (domestic) is China's leader in third-party online payments and has an estimated 300 million users. It works much like PayPal, where the consumer chooses to make a payment and is directed to the external Alipay (domestic) site, where they enter (or choose existing) payment information.&#x20;
