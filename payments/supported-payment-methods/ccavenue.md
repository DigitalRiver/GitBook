## How to configure

How you configure CCAvenue depends on whether you're using [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/) or [Drop-in payments](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/).&#x20;

| DigitalRiver.js with Elements            | Drop-in payments                                                                         |
