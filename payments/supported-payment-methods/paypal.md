# PayPal

A digital wallet allows shoppers to create an account tied to their card or bank account within the PayPal app. Standard PayPal Express Checkout offerings also include Pay Later options (when applicable) so shoppers can place orders but pay for them over time by leveraging [PayPal Credit](paypal-credit.md), [Pay in 3](paypal-pay-in-3.md), [Pay in 4](paypal-pay-in-4.md), or [RatenZahlung (Installment Payment)](paypal-ratenzahlung-installment-payment.md). &#x20;

## How to configure&#x20;

How you configure PayPal depends on whether you're using [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/) or [Drop-in payments](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/).  &#x20;

## How it works

PayPal uses a redirect then submit (RTS) payment flow.
