# PayPal Billing Agreement

Consumers can use their PayPal accounts to make recurring subscription payments. Consumers have the option to choose to auto-renew or manually renew. &#x20;

## How to configure&#x20;

Configuring the PayPal Billing Agreement depends on whether you use [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payments-solutions/digitalriver.js/) or[ Drop-in payments](../payments-solutions/drop-in/). &#x20;
