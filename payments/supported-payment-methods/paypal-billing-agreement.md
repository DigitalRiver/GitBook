# PayPal Billing Agreement

Consumers can use their PayPal accounts to make recurring subscription payments. Consumers have the option to choose to auto-renew or manually renew.&#x20;

## How to configure

Configuring the PayPal Billing Agreement depends on whether you use [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/) or [Drop-in payments](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/).  &#x20;
