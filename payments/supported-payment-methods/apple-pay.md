# Apple Pay

A fast and secure shopping experience where the consumer can quickly and seamlessly checkout with their Apple Touch authentication without login details or credentials. Digital River will support Apple Pay as a payment method on the payment service and DigitalRiver.js. Apple Pay is currently available to consumers in 21 countries and currently is supported only on IOS devices (iPhones, Macs, and so on).&#x20;

You can find an example of integration [here](https://drh.img.digitalriver.com/DRHM/Storefront/Site/drdod15/pb/multimedia/applepay.html) (only viewable on Apple devices).
