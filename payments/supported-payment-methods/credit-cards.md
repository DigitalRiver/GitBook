# Credit Cards

The Credit Card payment method supports the following credit cards: American Express, Diners, Discover, JCB, Maestro, MasterCard, Union Pay, and Visa.

You can find an example of integration [here](https://drh.img.digitalriver.com/DRHM/Storefront/Site/drdod15/pb/multimedia/creditcard.html).&#x20;

## How to configure&#x20;

How you configure credit cards depends on whether you're using [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/) or [Drop-in payments](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/).&#x20;
