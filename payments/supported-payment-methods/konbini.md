# Konbini

Konbini is a delayed fulfillment payment method, which means fulfillment happens after authorization and settlement.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Additional setup required:** If you are interested in using Konbini, contact your Customer Success Manager. The Customer Success Manager will send instructions to file an application form to obtain a client's unique ship ID from a local payment gateway. They will assist in completing the form in Japanese.
{% endhint %}

## How to configure

How you configure Konbini depends on whether you're using [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/) or [Drop-in payments](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/).   &#x20;
