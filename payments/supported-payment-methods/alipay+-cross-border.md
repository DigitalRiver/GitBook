# Alipay+ (cross-border)

Alipay+ (cross-border) is a digital wallet that redirects from the checkout page to a localized and familiar Alipay+ (cross-border) hosted page, similar to the PayPal experience. Alipay+ (cross-border) supports recurring payments. It's suitable for merchants who don't have a local entity but wish to provide a localized experience. Customers pay in CNY from the redirect page without encountering any currency conversion.

## How to configure&#x20;

How you configure Alipay+ (cross-border) depends on whether you're using [DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../payment-integrations-1/digitalriver.js/) or [Drop-in payments](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/).
