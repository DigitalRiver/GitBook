# Alipay+ (cross-border)

Alipay+ (cross-border) is a digital wallet operating as a redirect from the checkout page to a localized and familiar Alipay+ (cross-border) hosted page, similar to the PayPal experience. Alipay+ (cross-border) supports recurring payments. It's suitable for merchants who don't have a local entity but wish to provide a localized experience. Customers pay in CNY from the redirect page without encountering any currency conversion.
