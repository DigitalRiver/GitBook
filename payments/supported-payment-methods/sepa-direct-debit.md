# SEPA Direct Debit

Contact your Customer Success Manager and sign a SEPA Direct Debit addendum if you want to use SEPA Direct Debit. After you sign the Direct Debit addendum, the Customer Success Manager will send setup instructions for SEPA Direct Debit.

Digital River supports iDEAL for standalone and recurring with SEPA direct debit transactions.

Due to the risk of chargebacks, we don't recommend using SEPA to sell physical goods. Contact your Customer Success Manager for more information.

## How to configure&#x20;
