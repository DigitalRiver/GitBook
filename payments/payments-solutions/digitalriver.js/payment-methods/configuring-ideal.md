# Configuring iDEAL

If you're using[ DigitalRiver.js with Elements](../), you can create an [iDEAL ](../../../supported-payment-methods/ideal.md)payment method for your app or website by [creating an iDEAL element](../../../../general-resources/reference/elements/ideal-element.md#creating-an-ideal-element).

When applying iDEAL to a cart, use the [standard and delayed payment flow](../../../sources/using-the-source-identifier.md#standard-and-delayed-payment-flow).
