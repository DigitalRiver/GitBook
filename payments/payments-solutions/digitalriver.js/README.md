# DigitalRiver.js with Elements

You can use DigitalRiver.js with Elements to create custom payment flows that power your checkout experience. The [DigitalRiver.js library](../../../general-resources/reference/) allows you to capture sensitive customer data in a PCI-compliant manner, which is then returned to your service for interaction with the [cart ](../../../cart/creating-or-updating-a-cart/)in the [Commerce API](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-api-reference/).

## Getting started

Follow the instructions in the Elements integration guide and on the [Configuring payment methods](payment-methods/) page to learn how to integrate [our supported payment methods](../../supported-payment-methods/) into your app or website. You can also consult the [DigitalRiver.js reference](../../../general-resources/reference/) to learn more about the various [Elements ](../../../general-resources/reference/elements/)we offer.
