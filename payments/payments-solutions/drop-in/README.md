Drop-in Payments references the DigitalRiver.js library and provides a default look and feel that offers various levels of customization. Drop-in Payments automatically displays supported payments based on data collected during the cart session. Adding a new payment method does not require any additional implementation effort, but may require additional configuration steps.

For a list of payment methods supported by Drop-in Payments, see [Supported payment methods](../../supported-payment-methods.md).

## Getting started

Use the [Drop-in payments integration guide](drop-in-integration-guide.md) and the [Drop-in payments builder](https://drapi.io/drop-in-builder/) to learn how to integrate [our supported payment methods](../../supported-payment-methods.md) into your app or website.
