# Payments solutions

Commerce API allows you to use [Drop-in payments](drop-in/) or [DigitalRiver.js with elements](digitalriver.js/) to collect payments when a shopper [submits a cart](../../shopper-apis/cart/submitting-a-cart/).

Drop-in payments is a turnkey integration that allows you to dynamically update payment methods in your store's checkout experience. The integration uses the DigitalRiver.js library and comes with a standardized template that can be customized with minimal design work.&#x20;

DigitalRiver.js with elements is Digital River's javascript payments library, which enables you to build custom checkout flows, capture card details in a PCI-compliant manner, and interact with our Payments API.
