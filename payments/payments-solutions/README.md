# Payments solutions

You have two ways to handle payments.

[**Drop-in payments**](drop-in/)

Drop-in payments is a turnkey integration that allows you to update payment methods in your store's checkout experience dynamically. The integration uses the DigitalRiver.js library and has a standardized template that can be customized with minimal design work.&#x20;

[**DigitalRiver.js with Elements**](digitalriver.js/)

DigitalRiver.js is Digital River's javascript payments library, which enables you to build custom checkout flows, capture card details in a PCI-compliant manner, and interact with our Payments API.
