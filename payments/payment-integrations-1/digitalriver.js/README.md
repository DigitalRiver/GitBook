# DigitalRiver.js with Elements

You can use DigitalRiver.js with Elements to create custom payment flows that power your checkout experience. The [DigitalRiver.js library](reference/) allows you to capture sensitive customer data in a PCI-compliant manner, which is then returned to your service for interaction with [checkouts](../../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/) in the [Digital River APIs](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/).

## Getting started

Follow the instructions in the [Elements integration guide](quick-start.md) and the [Configuring payment methods](payment-methods/) page to learn how to integrate [our supported payment methods](../../supported-payment-methods/) into your app or website. You can also consult the [DigitalRiver.js reference](reference/) to learn more about our various e[lements](../../../developer-resources/reference/elements/).
