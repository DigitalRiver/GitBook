# How to ensure SCA compliance

For your integration to access our [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](./) solution, you must be using [payment sessions](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/payment-sessions.md). These are embedded in both [Drop-in payments](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/) and [DigitalRiver.js with elements](../../developer-resources/reference/elements/).

Use the following flowchart to find your appropriate SCA integration scenario:

| I'm using Drop-in payments               | You're already using our recommended, out-of-the-box solution for complying with SCA. To make sure you're using the tool correctly, review the [Drop-in payments ](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/)documentation and then [build your workflow](../../integration-options/checkouts/building-you-workflows/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| I'm using payment sessions with elements | You're currently using DigitalRiver.js in a way that gives you access to SCA flow handling. Your next steps involve [building your SCA workflow](../../integration-options/checkouts/building-you-workflows/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| I need to migrate to payment sessions    | You'll need to use [payment sessions](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/payment-sessions.md) to access SCA handling and compliance. [Drop-in payments](../payment-integrations-1/drop-in/) are the preferred method for performing this migration, but you can also migrate [directly to payment sessions](../../integration-options/checkouts/creating-checkouts/payment-sessions.md#migrating-to-payment-sessions) using DigitalRiver.js. Once you're done with the migration, you'll need to [build your SCA workflow](../../integration-options/checkouts/building-you-workflows/). |
