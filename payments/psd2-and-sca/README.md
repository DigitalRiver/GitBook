# PSD2 and SCA

The European Union's Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements became effective on September 14, 2019. These new requirements, part of the [second Payment Services Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366\_en) (PSD2) regulations, mandate that two-factor authentication be conducted on certain online transactions.

In this guide, you can find answers to your [basic questions on PSD2 and SCA](https://info.digitalriver.com/rs/348-QUY-258/images/Digital\_River\_Guide\_to\_PSD2\_Compliance\_2020.pdf) and how these regulations affect you as a merchant.

When you're ready to integrate, we [explain the different approaches](how-to-ensure-sca-compliance.md) to accessing our SCA solutions. And once you've decided on an approach, we outline the steps you must implement to [build SCA-compliant workflows](../building-your-workflows.md) for purchases and account management.
