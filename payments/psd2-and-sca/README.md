# PSD2 and SCA

The European Union's Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements became effective on September 14, 2019. These new requirements, part of the second [Payment Services Directive (PSD2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment\_Services\_Directive) regulations, mandate that two-factor authentication be conducted on certain online transactions.

When you're ready to integrate, we [explain the different approaches](how-to-ensure-sca-compliance.md) to accessing our SCA solutions. And once you've decided on an approach, we outline the steps you must implement to [build SCA-compliant purchases and account management workflows](../../integration-options/checkouts/building-you-workflows/).
