# HTTP response status codes

The Commerce API uses HTTP response status codes to signify whether an API request was successful. The responses are grouped into different classes based on the HTTP status codes. The 2xx range indicates that the request was successful, while the 4xx range indicates an error on the client side (for instance, due to an omitted parameter or a failed charge). The 5xx range indicates an error on Digital River's servers. Sometimes, errors may include an [error code](./), which is a brief explanation in the form of a short string.
