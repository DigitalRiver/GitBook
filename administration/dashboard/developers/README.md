| [API keys](api-keys/)     | Your account provides separate keys for testing and for running live transactions. You can use these keys when sending API requests in either test or live mode. Resources in one mode cannot change resources in another mode. |
| [Webhooks](webhooks/)     | Digital River uses webhooks to notify your application (endpoint URL) when events occur. A webhook contains the event and timestamp for the event. You can use the Webhooks section to view, edit, create, and delete webhooks. |
| [API logs](api-logs/)     | The API logs display the API requests and responses showing the status, method, URL, message, and request time.                                                                                                                 |
| [Event logs](event-logs/) | The Event logs display the event type, event ID, and timestamp for the event.                                                                                                                                                   |
