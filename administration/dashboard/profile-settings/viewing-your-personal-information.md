# Viewing your personal information

## Profile settings

Your **Personal information** (registered first name and last name and email address) appears in the upper portion of this page.

From this page, **Account security** settings are available. You can [change your password](updating-your-phone-number.md) or [enable multi-factor authentication](enabling-two-factor-authentication.md), as well as [update your trusted mobile number](updating-your-phone-number.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The Digital River Dashboard application provides multifactor authentication (MFA) to ensure maximum security. Choose your phone number or Google Authenticator [to set up MFA](enabling-two-factor-authentication.md). If you are using both Digital River Dashboard and eCompass, you are required to set up MFA for both applications. Use the same username and password for both applications, so you only need to set up MFA once. Your credentials are applied to both applications in the same way.
