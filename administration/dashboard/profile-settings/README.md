# Profile settings

Use the **Profile settings** page to view your [personal information](viewing-your-personal-information.md), [change your password](changing-your-password.md), update your trusted mobile [phone number](updating-your-phone-number.md), or [enable multi-factor authentication](enabling-two-factor-authentication.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The Digital River Dashboard application provides multifactor authentication (MFA) to ensure maximum security. Choose your phone number or Google Authenticator [to set up MFA](enabling-two-factor-authentication.md). If you are using both Digital River Dashboard and eCompass, you are required to set up MFA for both applications. Use the same username and password for both applications, so you only need to set up MFA once. Your credentials are applied to both applications in the same way.
{% endhint %}

To find your **Profile settings**, click your user name in the upper-right corner of the page to open a drop-down menu.
