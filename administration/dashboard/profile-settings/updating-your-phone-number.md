# Updating your phone number

You must keep your mobile phone number current in case you forget your password and for authentication purposes. If you forget your password, Digital River can use this information as a recovery method.

To update or change your trusted mobile phone number for account recovery, click your user name in the upper-right corner and click **Profile settings** on the dropdown menu to open the Profile settings page. Scroll down to the **SMS** setting in the **Account security** section and verify that this setting is enabled.
