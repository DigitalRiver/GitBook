# Enabling multi-factor authentication

You can choose from the following authentication factors to provide additional security for your Digital River account during login:

* SMS authentication - Uses SMS (short message service) to send a text message with a code for verification.
* Google authentication - Uses the Google Authenticator mobile app to create a unique security code on your phone to enter for verification.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The Digital River Dashboard application provides multifactor authentication (MFA) to ensure maximum security. Choose your phone number or Google Authenticator [to set up MFA](enabling-two-factor-authentication.md). If you are using both Digital River Dashboard and eCompass, you are required to set up MFA for both applications. Use the same username and password for both applications, so you only need to set up MFA once. Your credentials are applied to both applications in the same way.
{% endhint %}

To enable these settings, go to your **Profile settings** page after you have created your Digital River account. Scroll to **Multi-factor authentication** in the **Account security** section. The default setting for both methods is **Off.**

## Use SMS authentication

SMS authentication lets you require an additional login credential (besides just your username and password) to gain access to your account.

To do that, you provide access to your mobile phone by adding your mobile phone number to your Profile.  Digital River uses this trusted phone number to send a code to your phone to help verify your identity.

To enable SMS authentication, use the following steps:

1. On the **Profile settings** page, scroll to **Multi-factor authentication** in the **Account security** section and select **On** from the drop-down next to the **SMS** choice.\

2. In the supplied dialog, enter the trusted contact **Mobile phone number** to be used during authentication. You also must provide your account password.
3. Click **Add mobile phone number** to save the trusted phone number. The **SMS** selection now provides an **Update** link to click if you ever need to [update your phone number](updating-your-phone-number.md).\

A code is sent to your mobile phone number each time you sign in to help verify your identity. You need to enter this code to complete the sign-in process.

You may return to this page anytime to turn **Off** this feature using the same drop-down.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** When you turn this authentication method **Off**, you lose your saved phone number.
{% endhint %}

## Enable Google authentication

The Google authentication method lets you add an additional login credential (besides just your username and password) to gain access to your account.

To do that, you first provide access to your mobile phone by providing the mobile phone number in your **Profile Settings**.  After you install the Google Authenticator app on your phone, Digital River can then use the security code generated by the app to verify your identity.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You need to have a Google account to be able to use the Google authenticator mobile app. Refer to [Google Account Help](https://support.google.com/accounts/topic/2954345?hl=en\&ref\_topic=7667090) for more information on Google authentication and how to use it.
{% endhint %}

To enable Google authentication, use the following steps:

1. On the **Profile settings** page, scroll to **Multi-factor authentication** in the **Account security** section and select **On** from the drop-down next to the **Google authentication** choice.
2. When the Setup Google Authenticator modal appears, use the mobile device you are using to authenticate the displayed QR code. Scan this and follow the instructions to set up your account and begin generating security codes. Click **Activate.**\
