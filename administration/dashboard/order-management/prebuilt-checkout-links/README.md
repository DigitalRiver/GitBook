# Prebuilt Checkout links

You can [configure Prebuilt Checkout](../../settings/prebuilt-checkout.md) in the Digital River Dashboard to let you [generate Prebuilt Checkout links](generate-prebuilt-checkout-links.md) as an administrator or customer service representative. You then can share these links to connect a customer to an upstream commerce system with Digital River's payment processing, fraud detection, tax exemption, and disclosure services.&#x20;

You can [add a new or existing customer](add-a-customer-during-prebuilt-checkout.md) or [a new or current product](add-a-product-during-prebuilt-checkout.md) to the **Create Prebuilt Checkout link** page during the checkout so that that information is associated with the generated link.

You can provide additional helpful metadata for Sales or the client brand. For example, you could include data such as an opportunity ID, purchase order number, subscriber ID, or other relevant details. Use metadata to add necessary values to an order cart before emailing it to the end user.
