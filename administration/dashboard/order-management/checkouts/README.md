# Checkouts

The Checkouts list displays all [checkouts](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#tag/Checkouts) and provides a link to the [checkout details](viewing-the-checkout-details.md). You can use it to determine if there are any discrepancies between the checkout a customer created and the order placed, why a checkout failed, and why a customer abandoned certain cart items. You'll need the Administrator or Developer role to access Checkouts.

The most recent checkouts appear at the top of the list. Each checkout in the list includes a unique identifier, the creation date, the customer's email address, and the order total.
