# Searching for checkouts

You can search for checkouts by checkout ID or email address in the **Search** field.

The search only supports complete strings. Wildcards and partial searches will not retrieve proper results. To search for _jsmith@test.com_, you must enter `jsmith@test.com`, not just `jsmith`.
