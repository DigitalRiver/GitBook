# Downloading an invoice

The Download Invoice link is enabled on the Order details page when an order has an invoice. If no invoice is available, the link is disabled.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If an [order's](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#tag/Orders) `totalAmount` is `0`, then Digital River doesn't generate an invoice for that order.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
