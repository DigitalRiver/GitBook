# Viewing the order's timeline

The timeline shows everything that happened throughout the order's timeline. To view the order's timeline:

1. Click **Orders** in the left navigation. The Orders page appears.
2. [Filter your orders](filtering-your-orders.md), if needed.
3. Click the order ID link under the **ID** column. The Order details page appears.
4. Scroll down to **Timeline**.
5.  Choose either the **Entire order** to view the timeline of the entire order or a SKU identifier to view the timeline for a specific order from the **Timeline** dropdown list. The timeline shows the order status over time. You can view the timeline of the entire order as well as the individual SKU.\
