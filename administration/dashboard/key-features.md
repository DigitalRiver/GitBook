# Key features

## All-in-one API administrative tool

Digital River Dashboard is an administrative tool that allows you to test, manage, and monitor a Digital River API integration. Users may administer API keys, set up webhooks, view order data, and view financial reports in one easy-to-use interface.

## Test accounts

You can use a test account to test an integration without affecting Digital River data. A test account allows you to access and test the [Dashboard ](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/login)and Digital River API.

Want to test the Digital River API? [Create a free test account](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/signup). For more information, see the [Getting started guide](../../quick-start-guide.md).

## Test and production environments

Dashboard provides common workflows for reports, integration tools, and settings that you can use to manage your business. You can use the Test / Production toggle to view test or production environment data. Digital River uses unique API keys to distinguish between the test and production environments. Only paid accounts can use the production environment.

## Reporting

You can create reports for payouts, sales summaries, and sales summary details from the [Finance ](finance/)section. The Filter feature allows you to set the parameters for your report. After creating the report, export it to CSV or JSON.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**: You can create a payouts report for January and then export that report as a CSV or JSON file.
{% endhint %}

## Orders

You can manage your customers' orders from the [Order management](order-management/) section. The [Orders ](order-management/orders/)page lets you view order details, manage returns and refunds, and view an order's timeline. The [Checkouts ](order-management/checkouts/)page displays all checkouts and allows you to view order details.

## Integration

You can manage your integration with the Digital River API from the [Developers ](developers/)section. The Developers section provides the following integration tools:

* [API keys](developers/api-keys/)–You can view your API keys. You can also manage restricted keys for specific resource types and assign the appropriate permissions for those resource types.
* [Webhooks](developers/webhooks/)–You can create and manage your webhooks.
* [API logs](developers/api-logs/) and [Event logs](developers/event-logs/)–These logs provide the means to monitor the performance and health of your integration.

## Settings

You can manage users and roles associated with your account from [Settings](settings/).
