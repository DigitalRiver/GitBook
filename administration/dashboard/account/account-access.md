# Account access

Your account and role assigned to you determine your access to Digital River Dashboard features. If you have more than one account, your roles might vary between those accounts. Your role also determines your landing page when you sign in to Dashboard.

## Landing page

Your user role for the selected account defines your landing page as follows:

| User Role                   | Landing Page                                                     |
