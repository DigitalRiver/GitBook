# Finance

The Finance section displays payouts, sales summaries, and transactions. You'll need the Administrator or Financial Manager role to access financials.

Digital River encourages you to actively check each of your payouts and drill-down into its corresponding details. You can review not only the amounts you get paid but also the underlying transactions included in the payout by using the following three pages: [Payouts](payouts/), [Sales summaries](sales-summaries/), and [Transactions](transactions/).

## Transactions

Once an order has been fulfilled and invoiced, you can use the [Transactions ](transactions/)section to review the financial details of the order, including totals in both the shopping currency and in the payout currency designated in your contract with Digital River. You can also examine how impending payout amounts were calculated for a specific transaction, including deductions and adjustments such as tax, shipping, fees, Digital River share, or shipping discount.

## Sales summaries

Sales transactions are periodically aggregated into a single amount called a Sales Summary that is available to be included in a future payout. When a sales transaction has been grouped into a sales summary, the sales transaction is also updated to include a sales summary ID. You can use the [Sales summaries](sales-summaries/) section to review these aggregated amounts.

## Payouts

Sales summaries are periodically selected to be included in a payout. When a sales summary has been included in a payout, the sales summary is also updated to include a payout ID. Additional account-level service fees may also be combined with the sales summaries to create the payout. You can use the [Payouts ](payouts/)section to review all payouts issued to you and review the components of the payout.

The sales summary groups transactions into a batch. The client's SAP settings determine the interval. The payout groups sales into a batch, which may also include invoices from Digital River.

This section describes how to review your payouts from the [Digital River Dashboard](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/login). If you want to collect your payout information programmatically, see [Financials](broken-reference) for more information.
