# Payment methods

The Payment methods page displays all configured payment methods in alphabetical order. You can use it to [disable payment methods](disabling-a-payment-method.md), [enable and disable currencies](viewing-payment-method-details/enabling-currencies.md) for individual payment methods, and [manage the countries](viewing-payment-method-details/managing-countries.md) for individual payment methods. Administrators can manage payment methods from the Payment methods page.
