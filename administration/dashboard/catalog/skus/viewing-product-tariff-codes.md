# Viewing product tariff codes

SKUs use [tariff codes](../../../../general-resources/glossary.md#tariff-code) to simplify identifying and categorizing products in a customer catalog. Tariff codes are numbers in an internationally recognized numerical system created by the World Customs Organization (WCO). This term is sometimes used interchangeably with Harmonized System (HS) codes. Digital River uses tariff codes to make identifying and categorizing traded products easier. The codes are the basis of a worldwide import and export classification system.

The codes exist for every item involved in global commerce. While it may not be necessary for all international shipments, a tariff code is required on official shipping documents for tax assessment purposes.

To view a SKU's tariff code:

1. Click **SKUs** in the left navigation. The SKUs page appears.
2. Use the [Search](searching-for-skus.md) feature or scroll to find the SKU you want to view. Click the **SKU ID.** The SKU details page appears with the SKU information.
3.  Scroll down to the bottom of the [SKU details page](viewing-the-sku-details.md). Tariff codes associated with the SKU are displayed in the **Tariff code** subsection of the SKU details page.\
