On activation of a new Dashboard account, it may take up to two business days for all payment methods to be available for use. The payment methods available on a new test account will include all those marked as supported in the [test environment](../../developer-resources/testing-scenarios.md) as noted in [Supported payment methods](../../payments/payment-integrations-1/drop-in/#supported-payment-methods).

## Step 5: Choose an account

You will be directed to the landing page for your account once you sign in (your landing page is determined by your assigned role, such as User Manager or Finance Manager; see [Account Access](account/account-access.md)). If you have access to multiple accounts (see [Account](account/) for more information), you must choose an account to administer and click **Select**.

</div>

Click **Profile settings**. The settings that you can edit include [changing your password](profile-settings/changing-your-password.md), [updating your account recovery trusted phone number](profile-settings/updating-your-phone-number.md), and [enabling multi-factor authentication](profile-settings/enabling-two-factor-authentication.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The Digital River Dashboard application provides multifactor authentication (MFA) to ensure maximum security. Choose your phone number or Google Authenticator [to set up MFA](profile-settings/enabling-two-factor-authentication.md). If you are using both Digital River Dashboard and eCompass, you are required to set up MFA for both applications. Use the same username and password for both applications, so you only need to set up MFA once. Your credentials are applied to both applications in the same way.
