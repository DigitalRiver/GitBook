# Searching for customers

You can search for customers by entering the Customer ID or email address in the **Search** field.

The search only supports complete strings. Wildcards and partial searches do not retrieve any results. For example, to search for Customer ID ce942550-afa0-4a09-am-8679m-ajlkma, you must enter `ce942550-afa0-4a09-am-8679m-ajlkma,` not just `ce942550`.
