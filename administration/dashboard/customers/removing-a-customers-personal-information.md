# Recording a customer's request to be forgotten

Due to Digital River's legal and business obligations globally, we need to retain personal data for a defined period. We will remove the personal data once this period expires per our data retention policy.

To record a customer's request to be forgotten:

1. Click **All customers** in the left navigation. The Customers page appears.
2. [Search](searching-for-customers.md) or scroll to find the customer whose personal information you want to remove.
3. Click the customer ID link under the **Customer** **ID** column. The Customer details page appears.
4.  Under Account information, click the **Request removal of personal information** link.\
