# Fraud prevention

Digital Riverâ€™s in-house fraud engine is called Transaction Defender. Digital River accepts or declines a transaction based on their evaluation of the transaction. No manual setup is required. See [Ecommerce Fraud Protection](https://www.digitalriver.com/global-seller-services/fraud/) for details.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;If the **Order Status** in BigCommerce is set to **Manual Verification Required**, no action by the merchant is needed. Digital River manually reviews the transaction.
