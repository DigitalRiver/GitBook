# Caching responses

To reduce time and consume less bandwidth, you should cache information like the product price on your side. Cached responses improve performance by serving representations directly from the cache rather than the origin server.

You can configure caching in the Commerce API as follows:

* Globally enabled for all cacheable resources
* Enabled per resource
* Set similarly for related resources, such as enabling caching for Offers and Product Offers resources

Only cache responses from the GET requests. Caching is not enabled by default. For more information about enabling and configuring caching, contact your Digital River Representative.
