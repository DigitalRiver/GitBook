# Custom attributes

You can enrich your product catalog data by providing custom attributes for one or all products in your Digital River catalog. Common attributes describe a product, such as size, color, platform, and so forth.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: By default, the response does not include the custom attributes in an API call to a resource ([Categories](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-shopper-api/#tag/Categories), [Products](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-shopper-api/#tag/Products), [Offers](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/commerce-shopper-api/#tag/Offers)). Expand the `customAttributes=all` query parameter to return all of the configured custom attributes.
{% endhint %}
