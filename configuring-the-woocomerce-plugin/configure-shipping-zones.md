# Configure shipping zones

You are required to configure **Shipping Zones** along with **Shipping Methods** in case you are selling physical products. To configure the shipping zones and methods, go to **WooCommerce**, select **Settings**, and then click **Shipping**.

If a customer comes to the store from a country that is not configured as a shipping zone, they are unable to purchase that product.

Also, no taxes need to be configured for shipping since Digital River calculates taxes for shipping.

See [Setting up Shipping Zones](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/setting-up-shipping-zones/?) for instructions.
