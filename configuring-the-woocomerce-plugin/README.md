# Configure the extension

## **Geolocation service**

Geolocation service can be configured from the Integration tab. Go to **WooCommerce**, select **Settings**, and then click **Integration**.

WooCommerce allows shop owners to automatically geolocate customers and display tax rates and shipping methods specific to a customerâ€™s location. To determine the correct location for a customer, as of version 3.9+, WooCommerce uses integration with [MaxMind Geolocation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/maxmind-geolocation-integration/?). Use this optional setting if you would like to geolocate your customers.
