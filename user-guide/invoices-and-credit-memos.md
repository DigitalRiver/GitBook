## Invoice and credit memo flow

The Digital River Invoice and Credit Memo file information will be captured in the custom object `DR Invoice And Credit Memo`. When an `order.invoice.created` event is generated for an order, the Salesforce Lightning app consumes this webhook event and stamps the `Invoice File Id` on the custom `File ID` field and `Invoice` on the custom `File Type` field available on custom `DR Invoice` and `Credit Memo` object for the order in question.

Similarly, when an `order.credit_memo.created` event is generated for an order, the app consumes this webhook event and stamps the `Credit Memo File Id` on the custom `File ID` field and `Credit Memo` on the custom `File Type` field available on the custom `DR Invoice and Credit Memo` object for the order in question.&#x20;

## Download the invoice or credit memo file

To download the Invoice and/or Credit Memo for an Order, the customer must follow the steps below:

1. Log in to the storefront. The customer can view their orders by going to **My Account** and then selecting **My Orders**.
2. Go to the **Order Detail/Order Summary** page to open the order for which you need to download the Invoice/Credit Memo.
3. Click the **View Invoice/Credit Memo** link to download the **Invoice/Credit Memo** file.

The **Invoice** and/or **Credit Memo** links are available only on orders for which the Invoice File ID and/or Credit Memo File ID are generated and stamped on the `DR Invoice and Credit Memo` object.
