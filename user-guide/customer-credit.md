# Customer credit

The shopper can add customer credit to the payment page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The user interface for adding customer credit to the checkout will vary based on the use case and how it is implemented on the storefront.  We donâ€™t provide screenshots of this feature since we expected you to customize it per your requirements.
{% endhint %}

Whenever a shopper adds or removes customer credit from the checkout, the Checkout Summary, and Drop-in components will be refreshed to reflect the updated Amount Contributed and Remaining Amount values.
