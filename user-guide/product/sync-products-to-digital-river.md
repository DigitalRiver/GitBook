# Sync products to Digital River

Some products might not get auto-synced due to some technical issues. In that case, you can manually sync the products to Digital River.&#x20;

Go to **Tools**, select **Available Tools**, click **Sync products to Digital River**, and then click **Sync Products**. **Sync Products** will sync the remaining products.
