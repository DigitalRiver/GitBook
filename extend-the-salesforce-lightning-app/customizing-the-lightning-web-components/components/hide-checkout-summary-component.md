# Hide checkout summary component

Use the `drb2b_hideCheckoutSummary` component with the `drb2b_checkoutSummary` component when you use the `drb2b_Checkout` Summary component on the Checkout page (Experience builder) and not in the flow. This component conditionally hides or shows the checkout summary (`drb2b_checkoutSummay`) component.

If you use the drb2b\_hideCheckoutSummary component, we recommend that you include the component on every screen in the checkout flow and set the [Hide Checkout Summary designer attribute](../designer-attributes.md) as required per screen.
