# Step 2: Configure the Digital River app

The Digital River app uses the following settings:

* General Config&#x20;
* Product Sync&#x20;
* Fulfillment Config

The **General Config** tab provides settings to establish secure connections between the Salesforce Lightning app and Digital River. This tab also includes information (for example, Ship From Address**,** DR Default Entity, and DR API Endpoint) that will be used in the requests that will be sent to Digital River.&#x20;

The **Product** tab provides the batch job settings for syncing or re-syncing products between Salesforce and Digital River. See [Step 8: Configure and synchronize the products](step-8-configure-and-synchronize-the-products.md) for information on how to sync the products.

The **Fulfillment** tab provides configuration settings for batching fulfillments and cancellations.

## Configure the General Config settings

To configure the **General Config** settings:

1. Click **App Launcher** ![](<../.gitbook/assets/App launcher.png>).&#x20;
2. Type `Digital River App` in the **Search apps and items** field and click **Digital River App**. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Digital River App Search.png>)
3. Click the **General** tab. This tab includes fields for storing information.&#x20;
4. Enter the values in the following fields, such as the **DR Secret Key**, **DR Public Key**, and other fields to configure the Digital River app.&#x20;
5. Click **Test DR Connection** to verify whether you can successfully connect with the configured Digital River site. If there are errors, check your settings and try again.
6. Click **Save**.
