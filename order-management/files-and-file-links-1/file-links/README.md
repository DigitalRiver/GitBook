# File links

You can create a file link when you want to share the contents of a [File](https://www.digitalriver.com/docs/digital-river-api-reference/#tag/Files) object with a customer. If you want unauthenticated access to a file that a customer can download, you can create a file link that contains a URL that points to the file and then send it to the customer.
