# Warning objects

You may see a deployment error or warning message when [deploying a product](../../product-admin-api/asynchronous-product-api/deploying-a-product.md). These messages will identify the error or missing product information.

## Deployment error

A deployment error indicates a major setup issue with the product that will likely affect the sale and fulfillment of the product in your store. You cannot deploy products with deployment errors until you fix all errors. This prevents you from deploying a product that will fail to sell correctly in your store.

## Deployment warning

You can deploy products with warnings. However, we recommend that you fix all deployment warning errors before you deploy the product. If you deploy a product with errors, the product may not appear or function as expected.

## Live change warnings

You may see an error message when you [apply a live change to a base product](broken-reference) or [product variation](broken-reference) programmatically.
