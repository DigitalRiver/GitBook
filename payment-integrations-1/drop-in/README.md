# Drop-in

Drop-in is our all-in-one solution for accepting payments and ensuring compliance. Use this solution for a quick way to start accepting payments with ease.

Use Drop-in as your payment method solution if you want:

* To receive newly supported payment methods automatically without deploying code
* Out of the box support for PSD2; including Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)
* To ensure compliance for transactions and payment method collection/usage

Drop-in references the DigitalRiver.js library and provides a default look and feel that offers levels of customization. Drop-in automatically displays supported payments based on data collected during the cart session. Adding a new payment method does not require any additional implementation effort, but may require additional configuration steps.

See [Supported payment methods](../supported-payment-methods.md) for a list of payment methods supported by Drop-in.

If you want to customize the look and feel of Drop-in, see [Configuring payment methods within Drop-in](drop-in-integration-guide.md#configuring-payment-methods-within-drop-in) for more information.&#x20;
