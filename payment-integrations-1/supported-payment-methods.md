The table also lists each payment method's authentication flow and indicates whether it's supported in our test environment.

| Alipay                                    | Established in 2004, Alipay is China’s leader in third-party online payments and has an estimated 300 million users. Alipay is a delayed fulfillment payment method, meaning fulfillment occurs after authorization and settlement. It works much like PayPal, where the consumer chooses to make a payment and is directed to the external Alipay site, where they enter (or choose existing) payment information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
