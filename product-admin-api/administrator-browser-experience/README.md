# Administrator browser experience

Explore the resources for Digital River's Product Admin API suite for an end-to-end product administrator experience. The Product Admin API allows administrators to create, update, and retire products on your storefront.

The `products` in the URL represent the current product administrator session and the calls that you—the developer—make to manage products on your online store.
